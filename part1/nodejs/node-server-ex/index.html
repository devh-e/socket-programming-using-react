        <h1>What is a Nodejs?</h1>
        <section>
          Node.js is a popular open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime
          environment that allows developers to build fast, scalable, and
          server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js uses an
          event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it efficient and
          lightweight. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Google,
          which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome web browser.
          Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and
          server-side programming, allowing for code reuse and making it easier
          to build real-time web applications. Node.js has a large and active
          community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem of libraries
          and frameworks, making it one of the most popular tools for web
          development.
